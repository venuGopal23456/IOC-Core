# IOC-Core

Dependeny Injection Example
In this example Address class has a dependency with the test class

Here Dependency Injection is achieved through constructor
and also we can achieve through Setters.
<property name="address" ref=adrs>//setter Injection

Object Creation and Destruction can also be monitored
1)Init-method()
2)destroy-method()
  -Need to Downcast the Application Context to destroy it.
